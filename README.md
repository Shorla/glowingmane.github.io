#### Description:
Welcome to GlowingMane, the culmination of our CS50 final project.

GlowingMane embraces the diversity of hair, acknowledging natural curls, sleek straight locks, colored strands, and all variations. Our project aims to provide a unique approach to hair care for every user.

GlowingMane is accessible to all users, free of charge. Commence your journey to vibrant, healthy hair by clicking the 'Calculate My Hair Growth' button, exploring the tool, or learning more about GlowingMane.

#### PROJECT STRUCTURE:
The Glowing Mane app is crafted using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap for the frontend; Python and Flask for the backend; and Sqlite3 for the database. The project folder structure encompasses various elements, including static folders for images and CSS, a templates folder housing the HTML files, and Python files such as app.py and helpers.py. The heart of it all lies in the calculator.db file, our database, containing five tables to store user data, from login details to the latest hair length inputs.

#### HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION
Navigating through the eight pages of the application begins with the homepage, offering basic information about Glowing Mane. The About page delves deeper into our team, mission, and available support. Our blog page features a wealth of articles on hair care. The signup page allows users to register, leading to the login page, granting access to both the calculator and logout page. The calculator, the centerpiece of our website, consists of two forms. The first calculates the average monthly hair growth based on the last four months' input, while the second compares the latest input to the expected length, providing personalized commendations.

#### Motivation
Since childhood, I had to cut my hair because my mother wasn't familiar with caring for its unique texture. Fast forward to adulthood, my attempts to grow it out were met with challenges and damaged hair. Three years ago, I decided to start anew with a blend of research and a solid regimen, turning my hair care journey into a success. This personal experience fueled my passion for hair care and a desire to assist others. Recognizing gaps in the industry, particularly in accountability and record-keeping, led to the creation of the GlowingMane app.
